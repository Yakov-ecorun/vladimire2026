Hi! I'm Vladimir Poliakov.
I’m starting my path in Cloud, DevOps and Backend automation.
I actively learn Linux, Bash, Python, networking fundamentals and CI/CD concepts while building small but practical training projects.
Based in Novi Sad, Serbia.

I enjoy working with infrastructure, automating tasks, understanding how systems run under the hood, and continuously improving my skills through hands-on practice.
What I'm currently learning:
- Basic DevOps tools;
- Linux (ubuntu, network utilities, permissions, processes);
- Bash (scripts, pipelines);
- Python (automation scripts);
- Git & GitHub;
- Networking basics (TCP/IP, OSI, DNS, HTTP/SSH);
- Virtualization (VirtualBox/WSL).
