Hi! I'm Vladimir Poliakov.

I’m starting my journey in **Cloud, DevOps, and backend automation**, focusing on building a strong foundation through hands-on practice rather than just theory.

I actively learn and practice **Linux, Bash, Python, Git, networking fundamentals and CI/CD concepts**, while building small but practical projects that reflect real DevOps workflows — automation, monitoring, scripting, and troubleshooting.

I enjoy working close to infrastructure, automating repetitive tasks, understanding how systems work under the hood, and improving reliability through simple but effective tooling.

Currently based in **Novi Sad, Serbia**.

### 🔧 What I’m currently working with

- **Linux** (Ubuntu, filesystem, permissions, processes, networking utilities)
- **Bash** (automation scripts, conditions, loops, pipelines)
- **Python** (automation, monitoring scripts, logging, subprocess)
- **Git & GitHub** (clean workflow, meaningful commits, SSH authentication)
- **Networking fundamentals** (TCP/IP, OSI model, DNS, ICMP, HTTP, SSH)
- **Automation mindset** (exit codes, script orchestration, monitoring logic)
- **Virtualization** (VirtualBox / WSL)

---

### 🚀 What I’m building

- Python-based service monitoring (ping + HTTP checks)
- Bash scripts for orchestration and automation
- JSON-based configuration and structured logging
- Small DevOps-style projects designed to be usable in:
  - cron jobs
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - containerized environments

I’m continuously learning, improving, and expanding this setup step by step — with Docker, CI/CD, and cloud tooling coming next.
